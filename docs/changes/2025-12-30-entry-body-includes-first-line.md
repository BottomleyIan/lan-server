# Entry body includes first line

- What changed: entry body now includes the first line (minus the "- " prefix) plus all subsequent body lines, trimming trailing blank lines.
- Why it changed: task and note body should include the full entry content starting after the dash.
- New conventions/decisions: body is the full block content after the dash; raw_line remains the original first line for hashing.
- Follow-ups / TODOs: none.
