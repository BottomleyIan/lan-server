# Notes create endpoint

- What changed: added POST /notes to append a note entry for today using the same formatting as journal entries.
- Why it changed: prefer notes endpoints for all note operations instead of /journals.
- New conventions/decisions: note creation requires description and accepts tags/body.
- Follow-ups / TODOs: none.
