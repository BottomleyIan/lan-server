# Journal assets sibling folder

- What changed: journal assets now resolve to a sibling assets folder when present (Logseq default), with fallback to a nested assets directory.
- Why it changed: Logseq stores assets at the root alongside journals, not inside the journals folder.
- New conventions/decisions: prefer sibling assets directory if it exists.
- Follow-ups / TODOs: none.
