# 2025-12-15 bd tool workflow update

## What changed
- Added a note in `agents.md` to require the `bd` tool (Beads CLI) for all new non-Markdown work and issue tracking, referencing `.beads/README.md` for commands.

## Why it changed
- User requested adopting the `bd` tool for future non-Markdown changes and highlighted the Beads README; the working agreement now captures that rule and points to the Beads docs.

## New conventions / decisions
- Use the `bd` tool whenever doing new work that is not Markdown and for Beads issue tracking (see `.beads/README.md`).

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- None; ensure future non-Markdown tasks and issue updates use `bd` as the workflow tool.
