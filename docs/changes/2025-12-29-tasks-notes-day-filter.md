# Tasks and notes day filter

- What changed: added optional day filter support to /tasks and its query; /notes already supported day and remains unchanged.
- Why it changed: allow filtering both tasks and notes by day.
- New conventions/decisions: /tasks now accepts day (1-31) as a query parameter.
- Follow-ups / TODOs: none.
