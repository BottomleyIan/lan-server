# Tag graph uses entry tags

- What changed: tag graph now computes co-occurrence from journal_entries tags instead of per-journal tags.
- Why it changed: graph should reflect tags that appear together in the same note/task, not across the whole journal.
- New conventions/decisions: tag graph source is journal_entries.
- Follow-ups / TODOs: none.
